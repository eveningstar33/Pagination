# Pagination
Pagination using Maven, Servlet, JSP, JSTL, JDBC and MySQL database

When you work with large number of records, it is always recommended to use pagination. Otherwise it is time consuming to 
load all records in a single page. Pagination allows you to display only a part of records.

Pagination is an MVC web app and I'm using MySQL database to fetch records. Also I set up a connection pool.

I have created the company database and employee table with three fields: id, name and salary.
